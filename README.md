===================

RancorSynth Classic - now open sourced!

[Note - If you aren't familiar with GitHub, the "Download Zip" on the right side of the page is probably your best bet for getting the files. Then load the file RancorSynth_1_2_0.fsm in FlowStone (http://www.dsprobotics.com/download.php).  The trial version will work fine.]

Because simplicity is a virtue. 

rancorSynth is a free and open sourced software synthesizer that offers a streamlined interface for quick sound synthesis. It combines the most common modules many expert sound designers use in a very compact manner. This allows you to have many instances of the synth on the screen at one time and quickly adjust parameters, or layer many sounds together in an efficient way.

rancorSynth also has a unique "Rand" button which quickly randomizes all parameters. Lacking inspiration or ideas? Let the synth conjure up a sound for you! You can then use that sound as a starting point, or hit "Rand" again until you find something you like a bit better.
